## fe3h-enemy-randomizer

A script that randomizes enemy skills and separates them into tiers to allow difficulty-based randomization.

### How does it work

It takes all the skills, classes, weapons, battalions and items in the game and splits them into 6 levels of strength. Depending on how strong I want my enemy to be, there's a certain % a difficulty will be picked for every inventory part.
For instance, a "Level 1" enemy will have a high likelihood of being a generic Thief, having mediocre items, an incomplete skill list, and will generally be easy to mow down, while a late-game boss might end up with 6 Relics, a skill that completely negates Magic damage, and the "King of Liberation" class.

Enemies will be edited into the maps using a separate program. Non-boss enemies will have a `n` difficulty assigned to them (`n` being the general map difficulty depending on the story progression) and bosses will have an `n+1` difficulty. So for example, all of Kostas' goons in the tutorial are Level 1, while Kostas himself is Level 2.

Things will get dangerous as I approach Level 4 enemies. I intend on streaming a full Golden Deer run of it on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@n_tonio36). See you there!
